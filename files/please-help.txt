A KotlinTest project usually executes with Gradle or Maven,
and these tools know how to find all the test classes and
execute them one by one.

cyber-dojo uses the command-line only, so we don't have that
kind of intelligence out-of-the-box. Maybe you can help?
If so please email feedback@cyber-dojo.org

To get something working the test package and test class name
is hard-wired in the cyber-dojo.sh file. If you change the
test package name and/or the test class name you must update
cyber-dojo.sh appropriately.

Note that cyber-dojo.sh uses the option [--writer basic]
which writes red/green terminal colour codes to the output.
These don't render properly in a plain textarea and there appears
to be no way to turn it off. Maybe you can help?
If so please email feedback@cyber-dojo.org

If you write more than one test with the same name kotlin-test
appears to run no tests at all! Maybe you can help?
If so please email feedback@cyber-dojo.org
